# User tets 5 times to guess the word

# If the user guesses the word, the game will end

# Output users score and the color of each letter in a round

# Optional: Export the users score to a file and the color of each letter in a round to a file

# Optional: Allow for more than 5 letter words

# Multiplayer???
